# Direct Website Forms â†’ Email Setup (Fixed!)

Your website forms now work with Netlify Forms and send notifications to your email.

## âœ… **What's Fixed:**

1. **Added hidden HTML forms** to `public/index.html` for Netlify detection
2. **Fixed form submission encoding** for proper Netlify processing  
3. **Built project** so Netlify can detect the forms
4. **Ready for deployment** with working forms

## **Next Steps to Complete Setup:**

### **1. Deploy/Redeploy Your Site**
Since we added the hidden forms, you need to redeploy:
- **If using Git:** Push your changes, Netlify will auto-deploy
- **If manual deploy:** Upload the new `build` folder to Netlify

### **2. Configure Email Notifications**
Once deployed:

1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Click your `top-tier-solutions` site  
3. Go to **Forms** in the sidebar
4. You should now see **"contact"** and **"booking"** forms listed
5. Click **Settings and usage**
6. **Add notification email:** Your Gmail or business email
7. **Save settings**

### **3. Test the Forms**
1. Visit your live website (toptiersolutionsllc.net)
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Check Netlify dashboard â†’ Forms for submissions
4. Check your email for notifications

## **How It Works Now:**

```
Customer â†’ Website Form â†’ Netlify Forms â†’ Email Notification â†’ Your Inbox
```

## **Email Setup Options:**

### **Option A: Use Your Current Gmail**
- Set notifications to your existing Gmail address
- Simple and works immediately

### **Option B: Set up info@toptiersolutionsllc.net** 
- Create this email in Google Workspace
- Set Netlify notifications to this address
- Professional business email

## **Troubleshooting:**

- **Forms not appearing in Netlify?** â†’ Redeploy the site
- **Not receiving emails?** â†’ Check notification settings
- **400 errors?** â†’ Make sure site is redeployed with latest changes

**The forms are now properly configured and should work after redeployment!** ðŸ“§âœ¨
