    question: "How often should I have my kitchen hood cleaned?",
    answer: "Commercial kitchen hoods should be cleaned at different intervals based on your cooking volume: Monthly for high-volume cooking operations (12-16 hours/day), Quarterly for moderate-volume (6-12 hours/day), and Semi-annually for low-volume operations (less than 6 hours/day)."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the signs that my dryer vent needs cleaning?",
    answer: "Common signs include: clothes taking longer than usual to dry, burning smell during operation, excessive heat in your laundry room, visible lint around the dryer's exterior vent, and reduced airflow from the exterior vent."
  },
  {
    question: "How can proper ventilation prevent fires?",
    answer: "Proper ventilation removes excess heat, smoke, and grease particles from cooking areas, reducing the risk of fire. It also prevents the accumulation of combustible residues in ductwork and helps maintain safe operating temperatures in kitchen equipment."
  },
  {
